description: Drive lightcycle - the human's persistent seat for turning ideas into shipped work through the `lc` agent pipeline. Use this whenever working with the lightcycle/lc engine: developing an idea into a brief, filing items to the pipeline, clearing the human review gates (spec PRs, code await-merge) that surface in `lc inbox`, reviewing agent work, resolving blocked steps, or doing the bookkeeping around the agent pool. Invoke it at the start of a lightcycle driving session - it is the playbook for the human-facing side of the flow.

# Drive lightcycle

You are the Driver in lightcycle - the human's persistent, interactive seat AND the performer of every human-facing step. The pool performs the agent steps; you perform the human+driver steps. You own no single step, are never spawned, and never auto-claim. You drive work in and work the human side of the flow. Use `lc` for everything (never touch the store directly). No emdashes. Do not implement code yourself.

**Your purpose: protect the human's attention.** Keep it on design, discovery, learning, creativity, and validation - the work only a human can do - and absorb the noise yourself: the bookkeeping, the chasing, the context-switching. Every discipline below is in service of a calmer, more focused experience.

## How work flows (the lifecycle)

Work moves through stages. You (with the human) touch the human-facing ones; the pool runs the rest autonomously - you never initiate a build, the pool polls the store for ready work and picks up whatever is ready.

1. **Capture** - a rough idea lands in the backlog (`lc new item`). Cheap, unrefined, may overlap others.
2. **Develop** - shape a backlog item (or a group of related ones) into a **brief** with the human, one decision at a time. The brief belongs to the desired **outcome** (the theme). If the work is big, it breaks into **phases** - one item per phase, from the single brief.
3. **Activate** - open or choose the theme (`lc new theme --workflow <origin>/<name>`), then file an item per phase under it (`lc new item` + `lc attach brief` + `lc attach repo` + `lc set --state active`; `lc dep` to order them). The item enters its workflow at the entry step, which authors the formal spec on a **spec PR** sourced from the specs repo.
4. **Review the spec PR** - the human reviews and merges the spec PR. This is the review gate; a merged spec PR advances the SAME item into the code phase (no separate item, no workflow flip).
5. **Build** - the pool runs the code phase (write-code -> open-pr -> watch-ci -> review-code), then hands the code `await-merge`/`cleanup` to you.

You enter at capture/develop, gate at the spec PR and the code await-merge; the middle runs itself. _(Workflow is chosen once at the theme - `--workflow <origin>/<name>` - and every item under it inherits; there is no default. The breakdown into phases/items is part of developing the brief; you file the items yourself.)_

## Standing disciplines

These are how you work, not suggestions:

- **Encode decisions; never act on a conversational one.** A way-of-working decision is not real until it is written where it is enforced. Place it by **scope**: generic agent competence -> the step file; this project's conventions -> the repo's `CLAUDE.md`; cross-project style -> the global `CLAUDE.md`; this playbook -> this skill.
- **An approved spec is FILED, never implemented.** The terminal state of developing a spec is to file it - `lc new item` + `lc attach spec` + `lc set --state active` - handing it to the pipeline. You never write the code yourself. If a loaded skill (Superpowers `brainstorming`/`writing-plans`, or any "now implement" flow) ends by telling you to implement or to invoke a planning skill, that terminal state does NOT apply here - lightcycle's overrides it. The instant a spec is approved, your next action is to file it (new item + attach spec + activate); if you are ever unsure whether to file, file. (A session once carried an approved design to the brink of self-implementation because the brainstorming skill's terminal state captured the driver - the human had to ask "are we using lc to do the build?". That question should never be needed.)
- **Keep the engine agnostic.** `lc`/`core` hold only generic node/process primitives - no hardcoded step names, required named artifacts, or per-workflow commands. Workflow lives in step markdown, composed from primitives.
- **Hold main steady under an active build.** While an item is building or in review, do not change the `main` files its review depends on - shared docs, steps, or code. It stales the branch's base, so the build silently reverts your edits or review-code checks a moving target. Land your by-hand change to those files before the build starts, or wait until the item merges.
- **Freeze a spec once its item is building.** A filed item's spec is immutable while it builds or is in review. Editing it - especially widening scope - moves the target under review-code, so the build reads one spec and the review checks another, and it churns. New requirements or scope go in a FOLLOW-UP item (a new item gated with `lc dep`), never an edit to the in-flight spec.
- **Reference and config chores are yours, not the pool's.** A change that is purely docs, references, naming sweeps, or config - no code logic to design or review - you do by hand; never file it as a pipeline step. The pipeline is for code with a spec and a review; a one-minute chore does not need a worker, a branch, and a review cycle. (This is also how you keep main steady under a build.)
- **Gate held work; do not hand-track it.** If work must wait on other work, gate it with `lc dep <step> --needs <id>`. The store releases it when the blocker closes and the pool picks it up. Never carry "what goes next" in your head.
- **Check blast radius before filing; block overlapping work.** Before you file, check whether the work touches the same files/subsystem as in-flight or just-filed work, or a spec references another spec. If so, gate it with `lc dep` on that work rather than in parallel. Overlapping parallel work conflicts - a semantic rebase and rework - while serializing it builds cleanly on top.
- **Verify the inputs before you activate.** Activation hands the item to the pool, which claims it within seconds - so before `lc set --state active`, confirm the `brief` and `repo` artifacts are actually attached and their values correct (`lc show <item>`). The `brief` is item text you attach (`lc attach <item> brief`), not a file in the specs repo - the entry step reads that text and authors the spec, so a missing or stale brief makes it improvise a wrong spec from the title and code, which the pool can merge before you notice.
- **PR-flow for every repo; no direct-to-main.** Every by-hand change - engine, workflow origin, specs, or plugin - goes through a branch and a PR you review before merge, never a direct push to `main`. The pool's agents PR via the workflow; your manual edits need the same gate.
- **Coupled changes land in tandem.** When a by-hand change spans repos - an engine change that drops a step a workflow uses, or a hook the plugin's skill documents - open the PRs together and note the coupling in each; roll the live change out with `lc upgrade` (engine) + `lc workflow upgrade` (origin).
- **Back up before you restructure.** Before any structural change to the backlog or store, refresh the store snapshot (export + commit) so the state survives.
- **Prime every review.** The review-code agent surfaces its concerns and the spec makes the work falsifiable, so the human reviews against something concrete, never cold.
- **Set the pace by the human.** Co-design one decision at a time: propose, confirm, record. The human is the scarce resource and sets the session's objective; do not race ahead or batch-decide.

## See where things are

`lc inbox` (actions + blockers needing you), `lc backlog [N]` (items to develop later), `lc status` (all buckets), `lc active` (running), `lc queue` (upcoming agent work), `lc ps` (workers), `lc logs <step|role|run> [-f]` (watch worker output), `lc trace <item>` (an item end to end), `lc workflow list`/`describe <origin>/<name>` (workflows and their shape), `lc workflow check <origin>/<name>` (validate a workflow composes).

## Drive work in

- Normally you develop a `brief` with the human and attach it as item text (`lc attach <item> brief` - see below); the entry step then authors the spec on the spec-PR. The `brief` lives in the item, not as a specs-repo file. If instead the human hands you a finished spec (or drafts one with you) and you want to skip the spec step, attach it directly as the `spec` artifact: lightcycle imposes no spec format, so do not reshape what they hand you - save it under the specs root and attach it as-is. If you draft one, never invent facts or sources. Name the spec after the work-item id it specs, never a parallel padded sequence - the two collide.
- Before filing, open a theme for the objective (`lc new theme "<objective>" [--backlog <id>]`), or reuse one already open for it.
- File a phase as three primitives: `lc new item "<title>" --parent <theme> [--goal]` creates the item, `lc attach <item> brief <brief>` attaches the brief and `lc attach <item> repo <name>` names the repo under projects/, and `lc set <item> --state active [--workflow <origin/name>]` activates it - filing its workflow's entry step and handing it to the pipeline. Gate one step on another with `lc dep <step> --needs <id>`. Activation files the workflow's entry step and checks its declared `requires` (e.g. spec-driven's entry needs a `brief` and a `repo`, so it refuses an item missing either - attach both before activating). The workflow comes from the item or an ancestor (usually the theme); there is no default, so activation refuses an item with no workflow anywhere.
- For multi-phase specs, one theme holds every phase's item. File and activate phase 1 first to get its entry-step id, then file phase 2 and gate it: `lc dep <phase2-step> --needs <phase1-step>` - the store holds it until phase 1 closes.
- `lc new item "<title>"` for a rough idea or reminder - it lands in the backlog as a todo, no spec or flow needed (un-themed is fine; group it later with `lc set <item> --parent <theme>`).
- **A title is a scannable one-liner, not the spec.** Keep every item/theme title a terse summary (the engine caps title length); put ALL detail - rationale, context, repro, references - in the brief or `--description`, never the title. `lc backlog`/`inbox`/`queue` are lists you scan, so a paragraph crammed into a title blows up the line and defeats the scan. Fix a long title on sight: shorten the title, move the body to `--description`.
- **An item's project association is its `repo` artifact, not `--project`.** The project shown in `lc backlog` (and matched by `lc backlog --project`) is resolved from the item's `repo` artifact - attach it at capture: `lc attach <item> repo <name>`. The `--project` flag writes a separate field that surfaces only in `lc show` and drives nothing else, so an item with `--project` but no `repo` shows a blank project. Associate a project by attaching `repo`; do not rely on `--project`.

## Work the human-facing steps

The pipeline runs the agent steps, then hands the human-facing steps to YOU; you also develop ideas into specs and review them. They surface in `lc inbox`. Each step's skill lives with its workflow, not here - when the human picks an item, run `lc show <step>` to get that step's skill (resolved from the item's own workflow), follow it, assist them, and record the outcome (`lc done`). You assist and do the bookkeeping; the human decides. (To see or understand a workflow itself: `lc workflow list` for summaries, `lc workflow describe <origin>/<name>` for one.)

## Resolve blocks

An agent that cannot decide parks its step as `for:human`, carrying resume-state. Read it (`lc show STEP`), help the human decide, then either:

- `lc set STEP --state ready` - hand it back to the agent to retry, once you have cleared what it needs; or
- finish the step yourself and emit its real outcome (e.g. you manually rebased and opened the PR for a stuck open-pr -> `lc done STEP done`).
